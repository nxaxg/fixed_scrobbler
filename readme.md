Last.fm iTunes scrobbler fixed

THIS IS NOT PART OF MY WORK, BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO BE SPREAD WITH SOME OTHER PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM.
WORK DONE BY LAST.FM'S USER "SABERRE".
ALL CREDITS TO HIM.

"I built a 64-bit version of Scrobbler plug-in. Use this link to download. Remove the existing version of plug-in first, and put the new version in "C:\Users<your username>\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\iTunes\iTunes Plug-ins" (If your computer don't have it, just make one). You may need to install Visual C++ 2013 Runtime x64 since it's built with Visual Studio 2013."

CHEERS, AND SPREAD THE VVORD.
